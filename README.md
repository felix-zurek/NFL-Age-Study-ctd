# NFL-Age-Study-ctd
I expanded upon my age study done in [NFL-Age-Study](https://github.com/felix-zurek/NFL-Age-Study), by introducing an interaction into the model.

Using this model I looked at the draft history of GMs in the last five years to find out which GMs
gained the mosted Expected Approximate Value by drafting younger.
